        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I have strong interpersonal and communication skills for effective interaction with students, parents, and faculty members. I am skilled in terms of my problem-solving abilities to address academic, personal, and career-related challenges faced by students. I have proficiency in academic advising software and tools for tracking student progress and maintaining records. I also have empathy and active listening skills that allow me to understand and empathize with students' concerns and needs. I have the knowledge of academic programs, curriculum requirements, and resources to guide students in making informed decisions about their educational path. 
I have worked with kids in a variety of settings, including one that requires me to interact with them online through zoom. In that learning environment I teach them through a screen utilizing powerpoints and guiding them through any homework trouble or concepts they lacked in understanding. Iâ€™ve also engaged in helping staff at summer camps for elementary students as I expand my social skills and guide them as a leader/mentor. Iâ€™ve led seminars and workshops on time management, career planning, and study techniques to help students succeed in their fields of study. I have worked together with teachers and staff to create at-risk student intervention plans and raise retention rates. Iâ€™ve also incorporated the usage of cutting-edge counseling strategies, such peer mentorship programs or mindfulness exercises, to improve students' academic achievement and overall well-being. Alongside that, I have acted as a point of contact between students and academic departments, representing their needs and interests.I'm committed to giving students the tools they need to succeed academically and personally by offering extensive counseling and support services.
I've devoted myself to creating a more welcoming and inclusive learning environment where all students are encouraged to pursue their academic goals and feel respected. I'm dedicated to keeping up with the latest developments and industry standards in academic advising in order to consistently improve the standard of assistance given to students. I'm looking for chances to work together with academic staff, administrative personnel, and community partners to create comprehensive student support programs that cater to the various requirements of today's students. My proficiency in problem-solving allows me to efficiently handle a wide range of academic, personal, and career-related issues.
With my expertise in academic advising software, I can quicken administrative duties and provide students with more individualized support. I have promoted student achievement and engagement by leading workshops on career planning and study techniques. I've created intervention tactics in collaboration with the faculty to enhance student outcomes and retention rates. I lead creative projects like the use of mindfulness techniques and place a high value on the academic success and well-being of my students. I represent the needs of the students as a liaison, making sure they have access to the tools they need. My professional goal is to motivate students by promoting inclusive settings that encourage them to reach their objectives. I'm dedicated to continuous education, and I want to improve my abilities and knowledge in academic advising.
